**▪️ Cardinal Sine (sinc) Function**\
<br>
The sinc function is frequently encountered in signal processing. It is defined as:

**▪️ Definition**: A real-valued function $x(t)$ is said to be bandlimited to the frequency range $[-f_N, f_N ](f_N > 0)$ if its Fourier transform $$\hat{x}(f）$$ is $0$ for $$|f|> f_N$$.

**▪️ Sampling Theorem**: If a real-valued function $𝑥(𝑡)$ is bandlimited to the frequency
range $[−𝑓𝑁, 𝑓𝑁]$ and satisfies:
